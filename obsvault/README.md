# Welcome to //career.stevens.pro

Hello 👋,

This README *(homepage, index, home, etc.)* is for the git repo and the Website!

- Please note, this project was expanded from my attempt at creating a resume.
- Plan was to use the main tool behind my digital brain, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Using Obsidian allowed me to [[Transclusion - Wikipedia|Transclude]] *("include")*
created and works with

*(GitHub, Bitbucket, or other Markdown renderer won't work right, yet.)*

Open the root of this git repo as an Obsidian Vault for the best experience.

Fun starts in the [`career/` folder](README%20-%20Greg%20Stevens%20for%20Atlassian.md) :).

As well as **the only reason this vault exists, the most important piece as of 2022-04-16** -
[[README - Greg Stevens for Atlassian|my plead to work with Atlassian 🙏]].

1. 🎥 [[YouTube - @GregWorks - Featured GetToKnowMe Video#Featured Video|Get to Know Me Video (made for AWS, applicable to Atlassian)]]
	1. 8 minute #video, first 8 minutes of a 20 minute video I will happily share with you if you ask me.
	1. ~40+ hours put into learning [[Davinci Resolve]] to make this. #silly
	1. [[Atlassian]] opportunities drove me to create this repo, this resume, finally.
	1. I think I 💗 Atlassian, more [[career/sections/skills/Project Management|Project Management]] focused.

### Other Notes to Read

	- Generated by an Obsidian Plugin, may be a mess, but shows what has been worked on, without going through the git repo.
	- Or what I have published without actually posting to the git repo #DoBetter #TechDebt

### Associated Insomnia HTTP Testing Repo
I use [[Insomnia HTTP Testing]] to store collections of requests for a site.
It is easy enough for a [[Project Manager]] or [[Content Editor]] to create tests,
yet powerful enough to be ran as a part of a [[DevOps Pipeline]].
