### Part 1 (~1999, Okotoks)
(circa _(~~douchey~~ snobby term?)_ 1999)

- My Mom found support, sanity, within the JDRF community after I was diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes in Grade 6, at ~11 years old, circa 1999.
- The "JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes" was our event of choice.
- Attended several times as a family.

- Attended JDRF Research Symposiums, 
   - including a private (~8 ppl) dinner with the U of C Research Team, Dr. Louis... from U of C, and a couple top donors. Amazing exposure to a different life style.

### Part 2 (~18y/o, Calgary)

- Roller-blading (yes, bladez rulezz, 🔪) by the JDRF office on 17 Ave, I felt I should try to help them, since  ^sYyEZYbb
